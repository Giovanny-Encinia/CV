### Professional Summary
A strategic AI Leader and hands-on ML/GenAI Engineer with a proven ability to architect and build complex, end-to-end AI solutions from the ground up. My expertise is rooted in a deep understanding of algorithmic design and first-principles data engineering, which I apply to create the robust ETL and data pipelines (PySpark, Azure Databricks) that power sophisticated Generative AI systems. I lead the full product lifecycle: from foundational research to engineering stateful agents (LangGraph) and RAG pipelines, and deploying scalable services on Azure Kubernetes (AKS). I am passionate about translating ambitious business goals into high-impact AI products that deliver tangible, revenue-generating value.

### Professional Experience

**Artificial Intelligence Manager** | Hey Banco
*Monterrey, N.L. | September 2024 - Present*
Lead a high-impact AI team to deliver strategic initiatives that generate new business value. I drive the complete product lifecycle, from ideation to production, to transform core banking services, fostering a culture of innovation and ensuring my team's growth aligns with the company's strategic goals.
* Architected the 'Nudges API' from the ground up, creating an intelligent engine designed to increase user engagement and create personalized up-sell/cross-sell opportunities. I authored the complete technical blueprint that guided multiple engineering teams, creating a pivotal system that transforms the user experience by delivering proactive, revenue-generating financial advice.
* Engineered the agent's sophisticated, stateful conversational core to deepen customer relationships and build long-term loyalty. By designing a custom persistence layer for LangGraph states in ScyllaDB, we enabled a truly personalized experience with human-in-the-loop capabilities, making the bank an indispensable financial partner for its users.
* Ensure the reliability and scalability of mission-critical AI services by managing the full deployment lifecycle on Azure Kubernetes (AKS). My role in configuring the CI/CD pipeline is essential to guarantee uptime and performance, directly protecting the customer experience and the bank's reputation.
* Oversee the operational excellence of all production AI systems to drive continuous value. By enhancing monitoring systems and developing a Streamlit dashboard for performance metrics, I provide the business with actionable insights to optimize our AI solutions and maximize their ROI.

**Data Engineer** | CHUBB Business Services
*San Pedro, N.L. | April 2024 - August 2024*
* Optimized a critical cybersecurity ETL pipeline by re-engineering a Python script to incorporate multithreading. This enhancement enabled the scalable and efficient security assessment of a large portfolio of third-party companies by processing API data in parallel.
* Created a foundational data dictionary by mapping the complete data lineage of complex Informatica processes. This blueprint provided a vital, centralized view of how data flows between key tables and APIs, supporting data governance and accelerating future development projects.

**Data Scientist (Generative AI and NLP Focus)** | NEORIS-CEMEX
*San Pedro, N.L. | August 2022 - April 2024*
* Architected, built, and deployed a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system entirely from scratch, enabling semantic search across diverse and unstructured enterprise data (MS Docs, PDFs, images). This flagship project involved:
    * Developing custom data extraction algorithms and integrating the open-source PaddlePaddle OCR for image-to-text conversion, while actively troubleshooting and solving significant memory consumption challenges.
    * Engineering the core data processing logic by implementing custom functions for document splitting and text chunking, effectively replicating foundational components of modern frameworks like LangChain.
    * Building the semantic search engine by converting text chunks into vector embeddings using OpenAI models, implementing various similarity search metrics, and initially managing the index in Parquet files before evolving the architecture to highly scalable solutions like Redis and Azure AI Search for superior performance.
    * Orchestrating the entire workflow—from data ingestion and vectorization to retrieval—within a fully automated, production-ready Azure Databricks pipeline.
* Increased procurement efficiency by 30% by developing an end-to-end hierarchical classification solution. This complex project required:
    * Designing and building robust ETL data pipelines in PySpark to process and feed data to an XGBoost model.
    * Solving a critical data scarcity problem by implementing data augmentation and using Azure's data labeling tools.
    * Creating a human-in-the-loop feedback system with a Streamlit app, which allowed business users to correct predictions that were automatically fed back into the pipeline for continuous model retraining and improvement.
* Automated the invoice payment process, reducing processing time by 95% and errors by 99%. This was achieved by:
    * Engineering a resilient data pipeline using Azure Queues to consume, decode, and format email attachments for an LLM.
    * Implementing a hybrid solution that combined LangChain and OpenAI models with carefully designed rule-based heuristics to ensure maximum accuracy and reliability in payment categorization.
* Developed a specialized database consultant bot by adapting the open-source Vanna.ai framework and integrating it with LangChain and OpenAI models, enabling plant operators to solve machinery issues using natural language queries.

**Business Analyst** | NTTDATA
*San Pedro, N.L. | November 2021 - August 2022*
* Authored the technical blueprints for critical financial data pipelines, translating complex business requirements for credit card data into precise SQL pseudocode and detailed data flow specifications.
* This foundational work served as the master plan for the engineering team, enabling the successful development of systems that accurately assigned transaction and debt information to user accounts and ensuring data integrity for a core product feature.

**Jr. Data Scientist** | PRATHAMA-ENKI (for Soriana)
*San Pedro, N.L. | August 2021 - November 2021*
* Spearheaded the data-driven strategy to reduce merchandise shrinkage for the major retailer, Soriana. My initial research into academic and industry reports established the analytical framework for the entire project.
* Translated theoretical research into actionable business hypotheses, then designed and executed A/B tests to statistically validate their impact. This involved writing complex SQL queries on large-scale SQL Server databases to isolate key performance indicators.
* Empowered product managers with critical insights by developing and maintaining interactive Power BI dashboards. These tools were instrumental in visualizing the results of the A/B tests and influencing data-driven decisions to effectively reduce losses.

**Jr. Data Scientist** | VALIOT INC.
*San Pedro, N.L. | February 2021 - August 2021*
* Engineered a custom, high-performance graph traversal algorithm using Python. This recursive solution was purpose-built to efficiently navigate and query complex GraphQL structures, demonstrating a foundational ability to solve complex data access challenges.
* Built and maintained robust ETL pipelines to process high-volume, time-series data from industrial IoT sensors. This work was critical for feeding clean, structured data into the company's core machine learning models.
* Automated the end-to-end procurement forecasting process, replacing manual Excel-based workflows. This solution delivered significant improvements in both efficiency and accuracy for critical purchasing decisions.
* Applied foundational neural network and metaheuristic models to solve real-world manufacturing challenges, including process optimization and anomaly detection systems.
